# Screen Savers
I've had my share of fun times with creative coding, playing around with processing every now and again. 
So I thought: hey! why not put those random-using skills into something different and create some fun screen savers to pass the time. 
Enters ** this repo **. And you can check some other cool things out in [Open Processing](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/82824/#sketches) as well :) 

All original code here is MIT. Feel free to edit and make your own.

A Simple Pong-like ScreenSaver. It's relaxing to watch it jump around.
Btw, this is not original, i followed [Better Programming tutorial](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-make-a-custom-screensaver-for-mac-os-x-7e1650c13bd8) to get the hang of it.
